Meetup API magic

- We pulled data from api.meetup.com. Parsed it and displayed it in a tableView with a detailView. 

- The user can make new queries to the api to get different information. 

- View comments on each post returned from the API & a user profile for each comment poster.

**UITableView, UIWebView, NSURLConnection**
